Horizontal Picker for Sencha Touch 2
====================================

This is an example application created to demonstrate how the Picker.js component can be extended and adapted to produce a horizontally sliding picker in just a few steps.

Notes
====================================

- This demo was created upon [popular demand](http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?158125-Ext.Picker-why-not-make-it-so-slots-work-horizontally-too&p=701729&viewfull=1#post701729).
- Horizontal picker was initially developed with the developer preview of ST2 as part of an application I was building. It has been tested successfully from Developer Preview 1 to Beta-1 and Beta-2. It's very likely that it'll work with little or no adjustment with all versions up until PR release.
- Please, use Github for issues, pull requests, etc.
